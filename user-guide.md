## Best Practices

### Natural Language Instructions

When giving instructions to agents, be specific but use natural language:

- **Good:** "Analyze BTC price action over the past week, focusing on support/resistance levels and volume patterns"
- **Avoid:** "BTC analysis"

### Setting Reasonable Limits

Always configure appropriate limits for trading agents:

- Maximum trade size (% of portfolio or absolute amount)
- Maximum number of trades per day
- Maximum acceptable slippage

### Reviewing Agent Actions

- Check agent execution summaries regularly
- Review collaboration results before taking further action
- Monitor scheduled workflows to ensure they're performing as expected

### Iterative Refinement

Your agents learn from feedback:

1. Start with simple, well-defined tasks
2. Review the results and provide feedback
3. Gradually increase complexity as you build confidence
4. Refine your instructions based on what works best
