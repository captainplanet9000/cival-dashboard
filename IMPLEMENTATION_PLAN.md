# Trading Farm Platform: Windmill Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Trading Farm platform with Windmill IDE integration. The platform integrates Farms, Vaults, Brains, and ElizaOS Agents, using Windmill for workflow automation, monitoring, and internal tooling.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Frontend:** next-dashboard application (React/TypeScript)
2. **Main Backend API:** FastAPI (Python) 
3. **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB & pgvector, managed via Supabase
4. **Windmill Workflow Automation:** Handles scheduled jobs, event-triggered workflows, and data processing
5. **ElizaOS Runtime:** Agent system for automated trading and analysis

### Database Schema

We've implemented the database schema with the following migrations:

1. **Farm & Agent Integration (Phase 1):**
   - `farms` table for managing trading farms
   - `agents` table with `eliza_config` for agent configuration

2. **Vault System (Phase 2):**
   - `vaults` for storing farm funds
   - `vault_balances` to track asset balances
   - `linked_accounts` for exchange APIs and blockchain wallets
   - `transaction_logs` for deposit/withdrawal history

3. **Brain & Knowledge Management (Phase 3):**
   - `brains` for knowledge base management
   - `brain_documents` for document storage and processing
   - `document_chunks` with vector embeddings for semantic search

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundational Farm & Agent Integration

- **Database Migrations:** Created schema for farms and agents with proper timestamps and RLS policies
- **Windmill Scripts:** Added API testing scripts for farm and agent endpoints
- **ElizaOS Bridge:** Developed mock scripts for simulating ElizaOS calls
- **Workflow Integration:** Setup scripts to trigger workflow execution

### Phase 2: Vault System

- **Database Migrations:** Created schema for vaults, balances, accounts, and transaction logs
- **DepositMonitorFlow:** Implemented Windmill flow for monitoring external accounts
  - Fetches accounts requiring monitoring
  - Securely decrypts credentials
  - Checks for new deposits on exchanges and blockchains
  - Updates vault balances and logs transactions

### Phase 3: Brain & Knowledge Management

- **Database Migrations:** Created schema for brains, documents, and vector embeddings
- **DocumentIngestionFlow:** Implemented Windmill flow for processing uploaded documents
  - Handles webhook trigger from Supabase Storage
  - Parses documents based on file type
  - Chunks text and generates embeddings
  - Stores in database for semantic search
- **BrainQueryService:** Implemented service for querying the knowledge base
  - Generates embeddings for natural language queries
  - Performs vector similarity search
  - Optionally generates LLM synthesis of results

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Refinement (Future Work)

- **Goal Management:** Plan for implementing goal tracking and achievement
- **ElizaOS Runtime Management:** Full agent lifecycle management
- **API/Protocol Integration:** Supporting more exchanges and DeFi protocols
- **Advanced Analytics:** Transaction cost analysis and portfolio reporting

## Technology Stack

### Windmill Resources

- **supabase_connection:** Database connection details
- **openai_api_key:** For embeddings and LLM synthesis
- **vault_encryption_key:** For secure credential management
- **blockchain_node_urls:** For accessing blockchain networks
- **cex_api_keys:** For exchange API access

### Key Libraries Used

- **Python:** asyncio, supabase-py, openai, ccxt, web3
- **Database:** pgvector for vector embeddings
- **Document Processing:** pypdf, bs4, python-docx
- **Security:** cryptography for credential encryption/decryption

## Security Considerations

- Encrypted credentials using Fernet symmetric encryption
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in database
- API keys stored securely in Windmill resources
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing:** Test the complete flow from document upload to brain querying
2. **Frontend Implementation:** Build UI components for the next-dashboard application
3. **ElizaOS Integration:** Implement actual agent runtime management
4. **User Management:** Add multi-user support with proper permissions
5. **Monitoring & Alerting:** Add system monitoring and error reporting

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust foundation for the Trading Farm platform, with Windmill handling key automation and data processing tasks while integrating seamlessly with the main frontend and backend applications. The modular architecture allows for gradual enhancement and extension as the platform evolves.
