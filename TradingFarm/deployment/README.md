# TradingFarm Production Deployment

This directory contains configuration files and documentation for production deployment of the TradingFarm platform.

## Overview

The TradingFarm production deployment is built with the following core principles:

1. **Security First**: End-to-end encryption, IP restrictions, and multi-factor authentication protect sensitive trading data and operations.
2. **High Availability**: Redundant server architecture with automatic failover ensures constant uptime.
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Regular backups and recovery protocols safeguard against data loss.
4. **Performance**: Optimized for high-volume trading with minimal latency.
5. **Scalability**: Automatically scales resources based on current system load.

## Directory Structure

- `/security` - Security configurations, encryption settings and access controls
- `/infrastructure` - Docker, Kubernetes and cloud deployment configurations
- `/performance` - Performance testing scripts and optimization configurations
- `/monitoring` - Monitoring, alerting and logging configurations
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts for deployment and maintenance

## Quick Start

1. Review and modify all configuration files according to your environment
2. Run the deployment script: `./scripts/deploy.sh <environment>`
3. Verify the deployment: `./scripts/verify_deployment.sh <environment>`

## Security Considerations

Before deploying to production, ensure that:

1. All API keys have appropriate permission restrictions
2. Network access to critical components is restricted by IP and VPN
3. All deployment credentials are securely stored in a vault solution
4. Private keys for encryption are properly secured
5. Transaction verification mechanisms are properly configured

## Infrastructure Requirements

- Minimum of 3 server nodes for high availability
- Load balancer configuration
- Database with replication setup
- Secured network with proper firewall rules
- Monitoring and alerting system

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance activities:

1. Update security patches weekly
2. Review access logs daily
3. Perform full backup testing monthly
4. Conduct security penetration testing quarterly
5. Review and update scaling rules based on performance data
