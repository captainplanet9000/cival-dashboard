## Introduction to Multi-Agent Trading

### What is Multi-Agent Trading?

Multi-agent trading is an advanced approach to algorithmic trading where multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to achieve better trading outcomes. Rather than relying on a single agent to handle all aspects of trading, multi-agent systems distribute responsibilities among specialized agents that excel at specific tasks.

### Benefits of Multi-Agent Systems

- **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on what it does best (research, execution, risk management)
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can analyze different markets or timeframes simultaneously
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Different agents can approach the market with various strategies and viewpoints
- **Resilience**: The system continues to function even if one agent encounters issues
- **Scalability**: Easily add new capabilities by creating new specialized agents

### Multi-Agent Architecture in ElizaOS

The ElizaOS trading framework supports a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with:

1. **Coordinator Agents**: Oversee the overall strategy and delegate tasks
2. **Research Agents**: Analyze market data and generate trading signals
3. **Execution Agents**: Handle the actual trading operations
4. **Risk Management Agents**: Monitor and adjust exposure based on market conditions
5. **Data Collection Agents**: Gather and preprocess market and alternative data

## Agent Types and Roles

### Research Agents

Research agents focus on market analysis and signal generation. They typically:

- Analyze price data, order book dynamics, and market sentiment
- Identify potential trading opportunities based on various strategies
- Generate trade signals with conviction levels and timeframes
- Provide rationale for their analysis and recommendations

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "agent_type": "research_agent",
  "name": "TrendAnalyzer",
  "capabilities": ["technical_analysis", "sentiment_analysis"],
  "models": ["gpt-4o", "claude-3-opus"],
  "data_sources": ["price_data", "news", "social_media"],
  "timeframes": ["1h", "4h", "1d"],
  "trading_pairs": ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT", "SOL/USDT"]
}
```

### Trading Agents

Trading agents execute trades based on signals from research agents or their own analysis. They:

- Implement specific trading strategies
- Manage entry, exit, and position sizing
- Execute orders with appropriate timing and methods
- Adapt to changing market conditions

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "agent_type": "trading_agent",
  "name": "MomentumTrader",
  "capabilities": ["order_execution", "position_management"],
  "models": ["gpt-4o"],
  "strategy_id": "momentum_strategy",
  "risk_parameters": {
    "max_position_size": 0.1,
    "max_drawdown": 0.05,
    "take_profit": 0.03,
    "stop_loss": 0.02
  },
  "exchange_connection_id": "38f9d2a1-c5e2-4b5e-9a7f-1d6f8b300e12"
}
```

### Risk Management Agents

Risk management agents monitor portfolio risk and ensure trading activities remain within acceptable parameters:

- Monitor overall exposure and correlation
- Adjust position sizes based on volatility
- Implement circuit breakers during extreme market conditions
- Provide recommendations for portfolio rebalancing

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "agent_type": "risk_management_agent",
  "name": "RiskGuardian",
  "capabilities": ["risk_assessment", "drawdown_protection"],
  "models": ["claude-3-sonnet"],
  "parameters": {
    "max_portfolio_risk": 0.15,
    "volatility_adjustment": true,
    "correlation_threshold": 0.7,
    "max_exposure_per_asset": 0.2
  }
}
```

### Coordinator Agents

Coordinator agents orchestrate the activities of other agents:

- Assign tasks to specialized agents
- Aggregate and prioritize signals from research agents
- Resolve conflicts between competing recommendations
- Adjust the overall strategy based on performance

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "agent_type": "coordinator_agent",
  "name": "StrategyDirector",
  "capabilities": ["task_assignment", "conflict_resolution"],
  "models": ["gpt-4o"],
  "managed_agents": [
    "38f9d2a1-c5e2-4b5e-9a7f-1d6f8b300e12", // Research agent
    "45a1d3b2-e6f3-5c6e-0b8g-2e7f9c400f23", // Trading agent
    "56b2e4c3-f7g4-6d7f-1c9h-3f8g0d500g34"  // Risk management agent
  ],
  "coordination_parameters": {
    "signal_threshold": 0.7,
    "consensus_required": false,
    "risk_override_enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Setting Up Your First Agent Team

### Step 1: Plan Your Agent Architecture

Before creating agents, plan your architecture:
1. Determine the trading strategy you want to implement
2. Identify the specialized agents you'll need
3. Decide how agents will communicate and coordinate
4. Select appropriate models for each agent's tasks

### Step 2: Create a Research Agent

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Agents > Create Agent
2. Select "Research Agent" as the agent type
3. Configure capabilities and data sources
4. Select appropriate AI models
5. Define the markets and timeframes to analyze
6. Set up custom instructions that define the agent's research methodology

### Step 3: Create a Trading Agent

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Agents > Create Agent
2. Select "Trading Agent" as the agent type
3. Link to a predefined trading strategy
4. Configure risk parameters
5. Connect to an exchange (or paper trading account)
6. Define trading pairs and timeframes

### Step 4: Create a Risk Management Agent (Optional)

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Agents > Create Agent
2. Select "Risk Management Agent" as the agent type
3. Configure risk parameters and circuit breakers
4. Set up monitoring thresholds and alert settings

### Step 5: Create a Coordinator Agent

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Agents > Create Agent
2. Select "Coordinator Agent" as the agent type
3. Link to your research, trading, and risk management agents
4. Configure coordination parameters and decision rules

## Configuring Agent Coordination

Agent coordination is handled through the AgentCoordinationService, which manages the communication and task delegation between agents.

### Types of Coordination Actions

1. **Signal Transmission**: Research agents send trading signals to trading agents
2. **Task Delegation**: Coordinator agents assign tasks to specialized agents
3. **Information Requests**: Agents request specific information from other agents
4. **Alert Broadcasting**: Risk agents send alerts and override commands

### Setting Up Coordination Workflows

To configure coordination between your agents:

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Agents > [Coordinator Agent] > Coordination
2. Create new coordination workflows by defining:
   - Trigger conditions (e.g., "When research agent generates a signal")
   - Action flows (e.g., "Send signal to trading agent if confidence > 70%")
   - Feedback loops (e.g., "Report execution results back to research agent")

### Example: Research to Trading Workflow

Here's a sample coordination workflow for research-driven trading:

```json
{
  "workflow_name": "Research-Driven Trading",
  "trigger": {
    "agent_id": "<research_agent_id>",
    "event": "signal_generated",
    "conditions": [
      {"field": "confidence", "operator": ">=", "value": 0.7}
    ]
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "send_signal",
      "target_agent_id": "<trading_agent_id>",
      "data_mapping": {
        "signal_type": "signal_type",
        "direction": "direction",
        "symbol": "trading_pair",
        "timeframe": "timeframe",
        "entry_price": "suggested_entry"
      }
    }
  ],
  "feedback": {
    "target_agent_id": "<research_agent_id>",
    "events": ["order_executed", "order_failed"]
  }
}
```

## Strategy Optimization with Multiple Agents

Multi-agent systems enable more sophisticated strategy optimization approaches than single-agent systems.

### Collaborative Optimization

1. **Parameter Space Exploration**: Multiple research agents can explore different regions of the parameter space

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Monitoring > Alert Configuration
2. Create alerts for:
   - Agent communication failures
   - Unusual trading patterns
   - Risk threshold breaches
   - Model performance degradation
   - Exchange connection issues

## Advanced Multi-Agent Patterns

Once you're comfortable with basic multi-agent systems, explore these advanced patterns:

### Competing Agent Teams

Run multiple competing agent teams with different strategies and let them compete for capital allocation:

1. Create separate agent teams (each with research, trading, and risk agents)
2. Implement a performance-based capital allocation system
3. Periodically review and reallocate capital based on performance

### Specialist Networks

Create highly specialized agents that focus on specific market conditions:

1. Trend-following specialists
2. Mean-reversion specialists
3. Volatility breakout specialists
4. Market regime detection specialists

Coordinate these specialists through a meta-agent that activates them based on current market conditions.

### Hierarchical Decision Systems

Implement a hierarchical system with multiple levels of coordination:

1. Strategic Level: Long-term market view and asset allocation
2. Tactical Level: Medium-term trading decisions
3. Execution Level: Short-term trade timing and execution

Each level consists of multiple specialized agents that communicate both horizontally (with peers) and vertically (with agents at different levels).

### Self-Improving Systems

Design systems that continuously improve through:

1. Automatic strategy optimization based on recent performance
2. Dynamic agent role adjustments
3. Adaptive coordination parameters
4. Automated agent capability expansion
