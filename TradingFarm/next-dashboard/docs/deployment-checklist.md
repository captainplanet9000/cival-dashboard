- [ ] Application is deployed to production (`npm run deploy:production`)
- [ ] Smoke tests are performed

### Verification

- [ ] Support team briefed on new features and potential issues

### Documentation and Follow-up

- [ ] Deployment issues documented for future reference
- [ ] Lessons learned session scheduled
- [ ] Remaining minor issues tracked in backlog

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are identified during or after deployment, follow these steps:

1. Assess the severity of the issue
2. Make a go/no-go decision on rollback based on impact
3. If rollback decided:
   - Notify stakeholders of the issue and rollback decision
   - Execute the rollback script (`scripts/rollback-production.bat`)
   - Verify system functionality after rollback
   - Document the issues encountered
4. If no rollback:
   - Prioritize and fix critical issues
   - Deploy hotfix following expedited deployment process
   - Monitor the system closely

## Final Sign-off
