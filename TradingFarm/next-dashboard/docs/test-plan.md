# Trading Farm Dashboard Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Trading Farm dashboard application. It defines the testing approach, types of tests, test environments, and responsibilities for ensuring the application meets quality standards before deployment.

## Test Approach

### 1. Unit Testing (70% Coverage Target)
- **Scope**: Individual components, utilities, hooks, and services
- **Framework**: Vitest
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Exchange connector functionality
  - Trading utilities and core logic
  - UI component rendering and state management
  - Authentication and authorization logic
  - API interaction and data transformation

### 2. Integration Testing (80% Coverage Target for Critical Paths)
- **Scope**: Interaction between multiple components and systems
- **Framework**: Vitest + custom test harnesses
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Exchange API integration
  - Database operations and data persistence
  - End-to-end trading operations
  - Alert system and monitoring functionality
  - WebSocket connections and real-time updates

### 3. End-to-End Testing (Critical User Flows)
- **Scope**: Complete user journeys
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Focus Areas**:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Trading dashboard functionality
  - Exchange credential management
  - Order placement and management
  - Settings and preference management
  - Monitoring dashboard functionality

### 4. Performance Testing
- **Scope**: System behavior under load
- **Tools**: Lighthouse, custom load testing scripts
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Dashboard loading and rendering time
  - Trading operation response time
  - API response times under load
  - WebSocket performance with multiple connections
  - Database query performance

### 5. Security Testing
- **Scope**: Identifying vulnerabilities
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, ESLint security plugins, manual penetration testing
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Authentication and authorization
  - API security
  - Data validation
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
  - CSRF protection
  - Secure storage of credentials

## Test Environments

1. **Local Development**
   - Purpose: Development and unit testing
   - Setup: Local Next.js development server + Supabase local

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Purpose: Automated testing upon code changes
   - Setup: GitHub Actions workflow

3. **Staging**
   - Purpose: Integration and performance testing
   - Setup: Production-like environment with isolated database

4. **Production**
   - Purpose: Verification of deployed application
   - Setup: Actual production environment

## Test Data Management

1. **Mock Data**: Generated test data for unit and integration tests
2. **Anonymized Data**: Sanitized production data for staging testing
3. **Synthetic Transactions**: Generated trading data for performance testing

## Test Reporting

- Test results will be aggregated and reported through GitHub Actions
- Coverage reports will be generated for unit and integration tests
- Performance test metrics will be tracked over time to identify regressions
- Security scan results will be documented and tracked to resolution

## Continuous Testing Strategy

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run linting and unit tests
2. **CI Pipeline**: Execute all test suites on PR creation
3. **Scheduled Tests**: Run performance and security tests weekly
4. **Regression Tests**: Execute before each release

## Responsibilities

- **Developers**: Write and maintain unit tests and integration tests
- **QA**: Design and execute end-to-end tests
- **DevOps**: Maintain test infrastructure and monitor CI/CD pipeline
- **Security Team**: Perform security assessments and penetration testing

## Pass/Fail Criteria

- Unit test coverage must meet or exceed 70%
- All critical path integration tests must pass
- End-to-end tests for core user flows must pass
- No high or critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance metrics must meet defined thresholds
