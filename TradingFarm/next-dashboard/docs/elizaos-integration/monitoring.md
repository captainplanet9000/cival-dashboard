## Best Practices for Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring Routine

For effective ongoing monitoring, follow this daily routine:

1. Check the overview dashboard for any critical issues
2. Review recent alerts and resolve any pending items
3. Check performance metrics for active trading agents
4. Verify system health indicators
5. Review any recent anomalies or unusual patterns

### Alert Configuration Best Practices

When configuring alerts:

- **Start Conservative**: Begin with wider thresholds and narrow them over time
- **Prioritize Severity**: Reserve critical alerts for truly urgent issues
- **Reduce Noise**: Filter out routine notifications to avoid alert fatigue
- **Test Alerts**: Verify alert functionality in a test environment
- **Document Responses**: Create runbooks for responding to common alerts

### Performance Benchmarking

Establish performance benchmarks to identify degradation:

1. Document baseline performance metrics
2. Set acceptable thresholds for deviation
3. Create alerts for performance outside these thresholds
4. Periodically review and update benchmarks

## Troubleshooting Using Monitoring Data

When issues arise, use monitoring data for diagnosis:

1. Start with alerts to identify the affected components
2. Check system logs for errors or warnings
3. Review metrics leading up to the issue
4. Correlate with agent actions and market events
5. Use historical data to identify patterns

Common issues and their monitoring indicators:

| Issue | Key Monitoring Indicators |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Exchange Connectivity | API error rates, response times, connection status |
| Agent Performance | Decision times, error rates, memory usage |
| Trading Performance | Win rate changes, drawdown increases, P&L deviation |
