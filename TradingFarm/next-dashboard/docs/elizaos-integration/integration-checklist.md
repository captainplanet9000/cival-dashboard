## Notes and Observations

Use this section to document any specific observations, decisions, or special considerations that arose during the integration process.

1. The ElizaOS integration enhances Trading Farm with AI-powered autonomous trading capabilities, focusing on multi-agent coordination for improved decision making.
2. Paper trading mode is critical for safely testing strategies before live deployment - all agents should initially operate in paper trading mode.
3. The monitoring and alerting systems are essential for detecting trading anomalies and ensuring system health, especially with autonomous AI agents making trading decisions.
4. Redis implementation provides critical infrastructure for agent command queuing, knowledge sharing, and real-time agent coordination, significantly improving performance and reliability.
5. The Redis fallback system ensures the platform remains operational even if Redis connectivity is temporarily lost, switching to in-memory alternatives automatically.
