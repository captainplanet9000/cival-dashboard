# Improved Phased Deployment Plan for Trading Farm (Next.js + Vault) - Solo Operator

This plan outlines the deployment of the Trading Farm platform for a solo developer/operator, integrating the Next.js dashboard and the Flask-based Vault Banking system.

**Target Architecture:** Fully Integrated Next.js Deployment on Vercel (or similar), Vault Banking System (e.g., Containerized Service), Supabase Backend.

---

## Phase 1: Preparation & Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

**Goal:** Establish secure production environments and validate foundational configurations for solo operation.

1.  **Environment Configuration:**
    *   Create dedicated production Supabase project.
    *   Configure Supabase Auth for **single admin user** (e.g., email/password only, disable public sign-ups if desired).
    *   Generate necessary API keys (Supabase, Exchanges, etc.).
    *   Populate and secure `.env.production` for Next.js, including `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` (verify 32-char length).
    *   Configure environment variables for the Vault Banking System (Flask app).
    *   **Verify & Utilize Existing Secure Credential Storage:** Confirm the `/utils/crypto.ts` encryption and `exchange_credentials` table structure meet production security requirements. Plan for secure injection of `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`.

2.  **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
    *   Set up Vercel project for Next.js dashboard.
    *   Set up hosting/container orchestration for the Vault Banking System (e.g., Docker container on Cloud Run/ECS).
    *   Configure custom domains and DNS for both services.
    *   Provision and configure SSL/TLS certificates.
    *   Establish CI/CD pipeline structure (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated builds, tests, and deployments (optional but recommended for consistency).

3.  **Database Migration & Validation:**
    *   **Review & Finalize Migrations:** Confirm all migrations in `supabase/migrations`, including recent ones (`fix_agents_policy`, `risk_management`, `agent_tables`), are complete, tested, and production-ready.
    *   **Apply Migrations:** Run `npx supabase migration up` in a staging environment mirroring production.
    *   **Verify RLS & Triggers:** Audit relevant tables to ensure appropriate RLS policies (primarily checking against `auth.uid()` for the admin user) and `created_at`/`updated_at` triggers (`public.handle_updated_at`) are applied.
    *   **Generate Types:** Run `npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/database.types.ts` after applying migrations and commit the updated file.
    *   Establish production database backup and recovery strategy.

4.  **Rollback Strategy Definition:**
    *   Define a clear rollback procedure for infrastructure changes and database migrations.

## Phase 2: Initial Deployment & Core Validation (Week 2)

**Goal:** Deploy baseline applications and validate core functionality and connectivity.

1.  **Next.js Deployment Optimization:**
    *   Configure `next.config.js` for production (e.g., `reactStrictMode: true`, SWC minification).
    *   Configure Tailwind CSS purging for production (`tailwind.config.js`).
    *   Execute production build (`next build`) via CI/CD or manually, ensuring TypeScript type checking passes.
    *   Review `node scripts/production-deployment.js` - determine if still needed or if `next build` suffices.

2.  **Core Functionality Deployment (via CI/CD or Manual):**
    *   **Next.js App:** Deploy Authentication (for admin user), basic Dashboard layout, core navigation, and ensure `shadcn/ui` components render correctly.
    *   **Vault Banking App:** Deploy the Flask application to its target environment.

3.  **Initial Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Connectivity:** Verify Next.js connects to Supabase, Vault app connects to its dependencies (if any).
    *   **Authentication:** Test admin user login, logout.
    *   **Basic UI:** Validate core layout, responsiveness across devices/browsers, and basic component interactions.
    *   **Vault API:** Test basic API endpoints of the Vault system.
    *   **Run Core Test Suites:** Execute existing Unit and Component tests via CI/CD or manually.

4.  **Monitoring & Error Tracking Setup:**
    *   Configure Vercel Analytics/Logging (or alternatives like Datadog, Sentry) for Next.js.
    *   Configure logging and error tracking for the Vault Banking System.
    *   Set up basic availability alerts.

## Phase 3: Feature Deployment & Integration (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal:** Deploy core trading and banking features, ensuring seamless integration.

1.  **Trading Engine Integration (via CI/CD or Manual):**
    *   **Deploy & Configure Existing Connectors:** Deploy exchange connector logic (Coinbase, Bybit, etc.). Configure production API credentials securely.
    *   **Validate Real-time Data:** Implement and test WebSocket connections for live market data updates.
    *   **Order Execution:** Deploy order placement/cancellation logic. Test thoroughly.
    *   **Deploy Exchange Credential Management:** Deploy the `ConnectExchangeModal` and associated API (`/api/credentials`) for managing keys.

2.  **Vault Banking System Integration (via CI/CD or Manual):**
    *   Deploy API endpoints for transactions, wallet management, transfers.
    *   Integrate Vault features into the Next.js dashboard (link, data fetching).
    *   Test end-to-end banking operations (transfers, balance checks).

3.  **Dashboard & Analytics Systems (via CI/CD or Manual):**
    *   Deploy dashboard widget system and core analytics components.
    *   Integrate market data visualization.
    *   Validate data accuracy and real-time updates.

4.  **Integration & Performance Testing:**
    *   Execute Integration tests covering flows between Next.js, Supabase, and Vault.
    *   Perform initial performance tests on critical API routes and data loading.
    *   Implement server-side caching (Next.js ISR/SSR) and CDN configurations.
    *   Optimize database queries identified during testing.

## Phase 4: Agent System & Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal:** Deploy the agent orchestration system and advanced trading/risk features.

1.  **Agent Framework Deployment (via CI/CD or Manual):**
    *   **Deploy Existing Systems:** Deploy agent orchestration logic, Agent Health Monitoring, and Strategy Management components.
    *   Deploy secure API routes for agent operations.
    *   Configure agent monitoring and controls in the UI.

2.  **Advanced Trading & Risk Features (via CI/CD or Manual):**
    *   Deploy Risk Management systems.
    *   Deploy Position Management dashboard.
    *   Enable portfolio analytics features.

3.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   Perform security audit (dependency scanning, vulnerability checks).
    *   Implement rate limiting (Vercel, Cloudflare, or application-level).
    *   Review and enhance authentication/authorization checks, ensuring they align with single-user access.
    *   Verify encryption at rest (Supabase) and in transit (SSL/TLS).

4.  **Self-Validation:**
    *   Thoroughly test all major features deployed so far from the operator's perspective.
    *   Address any critical issues found during validation.

1.  **Scaling Infrastructure (as needed):**
    *   Configure auto-scaling for Vault System containers (if applicable and load requires).
    *   Implement database connection pooling (Supabase handles this, but verify limits).
    *   Review Vercel function resource allocation and optimize.
    *   Consider load balancing strategies if deploying Vault to multiple instances (if needed).

2.  **Comprehensive Monitoring & Alerting:**
    *   Finalize monitoring dashboards (Vercel, Sentry, etc.).
