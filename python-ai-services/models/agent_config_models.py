# This model is intended to be serialized to JSON and stored in a database field,
# likely within the `trading_agents.configuration_parameters` if this configuration
# is for the agent's persona/setup within a trading strategy context.
# Or, it could be part of a larger JSON structure in that field.
# Renamed `strategy_specific_params` to `additional_params` for more generality.
# Corrected Field `min_length` for role, goal, backstory as per original intent (not 0).
# Changed `tools` to be commented out as it's a placeholder.
# Added validator for llm_identifier.
# Using `Optional[str]` for llm_identifier and validating against AVAILABLE_LLM_IDENTIFIERS.
# `Literal` would be cleaner but `validator` provides compatibility.
# `default_factory=dict` is good for mutable defaults like dicts/lists.
# `extra = 'forbid'` in Config is good practice.
# Removed `min_length=0` as `...` (ellipsis) for required fields implies they must be provided.
# Min_length values for role, goal, backstory were set to reasonable minimums.
# Changed `strategy_specific_params` to `additional_params` for more general use.
# Corrected description for `allow_delegation`.
# Corrected description for `verbose`.
# Corrected description for `llm_identifier` to be more informative.
# Updated `AVAILABLE_LLM_IDENTIFIERS` with more common examples.
# Updated validator message.
# Added `validator` import from Pydantic.
# Updated field descriptions to be more consistent and clear.
# Added comments on how this model might be used/stored.
# Final review of field descriptions and constraints.
# The field `llm_identifier` should allow `None` (to use a crew default).
# The validator correctly handles `None`.
# The `description` for `llm_identifier` also clarifies that `None` means using a default.
# The `AVAILABLE_LLM_IDENTIFIERS` list is a placeholder and ideally should be more dynamic or sourced from `crew_llm_config.py` eventually.
# The model seems robust for now.
# The task specifies "strategy_specific_params" so I'll revert "additional_params" to that.
# The task also used "AVAILABLE_LLM_IDENTIFIERS = ["gemini-1.5-flash-latest", "openai-gpt-4-placeholder"]"
# so I'll use that specific list for consistency with the prompt.
# Re-checking the field name `strategy_specific_params` vs `additional_params`. The prompt used `strategy_specific_params`.
# I'll stick to `strategy_specific_params` as requested.
# The prompt also had `tools: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None` not commented out, so I'll ensure it's present.
# However, the prompt's model did not have `default_factory=list` for tools. It was `None`.
# I will ensure it's `None` by default.
# Re-added `tools` as an active field.
# The `strategy_specific_params` field was correctly set with `default_factory=dict`.
# The `AVAILABLE_LLM_IDENTIFIERS` list is now exactly as in the prompt.
# The validator for `llm_identifier` is in place and correct.
# Looks good to go.
# Final check on field names and defaults:
# `role`, `goal`, `backstory` are required.
# `llm_identifier` is Optional[str], defaults to None.
# `allow_delegation` is bool, defaults to False.
# `verbose` is bool, defaults to True.
# `tools` is Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]], defaults to None.
# `strategy_specific_params` is Optional[Dict[str, Any]], defaults to an empty dict.
# This all matches the intent.
