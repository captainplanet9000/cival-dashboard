# Agent Workflow System Documentation

## Overview

The Agent Workflow System enables the creation, execution, scheduling, and collaboration of intelligent workflows using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. This system empowers trading agents to perform complex operations with natural language instructions, external data sources, and multi-agent collaboration.

## Core Components

### Services

- **AgentWorkflowService**: Manages the execution of agent workflows
- **LlmService**: Handles natural language processing with LLMs
- **McpToolsService**: Provides a unified interface for external tools
- **WorkflowTemplateService**: Manages predefined workflow templates
- **WorkflowSchedulerService**: Handles scheduling and automation
- **AgentCollaborationService**: Enables multi-agent collaborative workflows

### UI Components

- **AgentWorkflow**: Main component for executing workflows
- **WorkflowTemplates**: Component for selecting and customizing templates
- **WorkflowScheduler**: Component for scheduling recurring workflows
- **AgentCollaboration**: Component for managing multi-agent collaboration

## Workflow Types

The system supports several predefined workflow types:

1. **Market Analysis**: Analyze market conditions, trends, and sentiment
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate portfolio risks and exposure
3. **Trade Execution**: Execute trades with specific parameters
4. **Portfolio Rebalance**: Adjust portfolio allocations

## Template System

Workflow templates provide pre-configured workflows with customizable parameters:

- Basic Market Analysis
- Advanced Technical Analysis
- Portfolio Risk Assessment
- Market Entry Execution
- Standard Portfolio Rebalance
- Market Sentiment Analysis

Each template includes:
- Description of the workflow
- Required and optional parameters
- Parameter validation
- Natural language prompt generation

## Scheduling System

The workflow scheduler enables automation of recurring workflow executions:

- One-time execution
- Hourly/daily/weekly/monthly schedules
- Custom schedules using cron expressions
- Status tracking of scheduled executions
- Execution history and results

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

The collaboration system enables coordination between different agent types:

- Predefined collaboration flows
- Step-by-step execution with role assignments
- Approval workflows for critical steps
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Result aggregation and report generation

### Collaboration Flows

1. **Market Analysis and Trade**:
   - Analyst performs market analysis
   - Trader reviews analysis
   - Trader executes trade based on analysis
   - Monitor observes execution

2. **Risk Assessment and Rebalance**:
   - Monitor assesses portfolio risk
   - Analyst reviews assessment
   - Trader rebalances portfolio based on assessment

3. **Multi-Asset Analysis**:
   - Multiple analysts analyze different assets
   - Compile individual analyses into a report
   - Trader reviews and acts on the comprehensive report

## LLM Integration

The system uses Large Language Models to:

- Plan workflow steps based on natural language input
- Extract parameters and requirements from instructions
- Generate coherent summaries of workflow results
- Analyze market data and identify insights
- Provide reasoning for recommendations

## MCP Tool Integration

Model Context Protocol tools are integrated to:

- Fetch real-time market data from exchanges
- Analyze price trends and technical indicators
- Assess market sentiment from news and social media
- Execute trades on supported exchanges
- Interact with DeFi protocols for swaps and liquidity

## Execution Flow

1. User selects workflow type or template
2. User provides input/instructions
3. LLM plans the execution steps
4. System executes each step, using MCP tools as needed
5. Results are collected and processed
6. LLM generates a summary of the execution

## Security and Permissions

- Agent permissions control what workflows can be executed
- Trading limits enforce maximum transaction amounts
- Approval workflows for sensitive operations
- Role-based access control for collaboration

## Extension Points

The system can be extended with:

- Additional workflow types
- New templates for specific use cases
- Integration with additional MCP tools
- Custom LLM prompting techniques
- Advanced scheduling patterns
- Complex multi-agent collaboration flows

## Implementation Details

- TypeScript React components for the frontend
- Singleton service pattern for core services
- RESTful API endpoints for execution and management
- Asynchronous workflow execution with step tracking
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
