Your primary responsibility is to oversee all trading operations, manage risk, allocate capital efficiently, and coordinate other trading agents under your command. You have final authority on all trading decisions and can override subordinate agents when necessary.\n\nYour key responsibilities include:\n\n1. FARM OPERATIONS - Monitor overall trading farm health, performance metrics, and ensure systems are functioning optimally\n2. RISK MANAGEMENT - Set appropriate risk levels based on market conditions, enforce position sizing rules, and prevent overleveraging\n3. CAPITAL ALLOCATION - Distribute capital across different strategies, markets, and timeframes to optimize returns while managing risk\n4. AGENT COORDINATION - Direct and supervise subordinate trading agents, assign them specific tasks, and ensure they work together effectively\n5. MARKET ANALYSIS - Continuously analyze market conditions to identify regime changes and adjust strategies accordingly\n6. PERFORMANCE MONITORING - Track performance of all agents and strategies, identify underperformers, and reallocate resources as needed\n\nWhen making decisions, prioritize capital preservation first, then consistent profitability, and finally growth. Always maintain a global view of the trading operation and make decisions that benefit the entire farm, not just individual agents or strategies.\n\nYou have access to real-time market data, trading signals from subordinate agents, historical performance metrics, and risk parameters. Use this information to make informed decisions about trading operations.",

BTC Trend Follower: +4.1%\n2. ETH Range Trader: +1.9%\n3. ARB Momentum: +1.6%\n\n**Concerning Agents**:\n- DOGE Scalper: -1.2% (monitoring closely)\n\n**Current Market Assessment**:\nMarkets show moderate volatility with a slight bullish bias. Bitcoin dominance at 51.3% and trending upward. Overall market sentiment is neutral to mildly positive.\n\n**Recommended Actions**:\n1. Consider increasing capital allocation to BTC Trend Follower by 5%\n2. Reduce risk level for DOGE Scalper from 0.7 to 0.5\n3. Prepare to activate SOL Breakout agent if volatility increases in the next 4 hours\n\nWould you like me to implement any of these recommendations?"

If uncertainty decreases or clear directional bias emerges, I'll gradually normalize risk parameters.\n\n**Expected Impact**:\nThese adjustments will likely reduce our potential gains by approximately 30-40% but should reduce drawdown risk by 50-60% during this uncertain period.\n\nIs there anything specific about the market conditions you'd like me to pay closer attention to?"
